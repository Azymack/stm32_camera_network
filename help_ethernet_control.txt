‚úÖ Short Answer
CubeMX does not provide a dedicated configuration option for LAN8720.
But you can use the LAN8742 preset as a template ‚Äî just manually adjust the PHY address and configuration in code.

üîç Why LAN8720 is Missing from CubeMX
CubeMX supports LAN8742A by default since it's more commonly used with STM32 Nucleo and Discovery boards.

LAN8720 and LAN8742 are both IEEE 802.3-compliant 10/100 Ethernet PHYs, and share the same interface: RMII.

The key differences (like register sets) are minor and can be accounted for in low-level code (HAL or LwIP PHY driver).

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use LAN8720 in CubeMX
Select LAN8742 in CubeMX (this sets up RMII pins and LwIP stack).

After generating the code, modify these things manually:

1. Set the correct PHY address
By default, LAN8720 usually uses PHY address 0x01, while LAN8742 uses 0x00.

In stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h or similar:

c
Copy
Edit
#define LAN8720A_PHY_ADDRESS    0x01U
Or in ethernetif.c, modify:

c
Copy
Edit
#define DP83848_PHY_ADDRESS     0x01U // replace if there's a default one
2. Adjust any PHY-specific functions (optional)
If you're not using the default PHY driver or you run into link issues, modify the PHY register access or add delays.

3. Check pin configuration (RMII)
Make sure your clock input is 50MHz (LAN8720 requires this).

Set RMII_REF_CLK as input from external oscillator (usually connected to LAN8720).

Enable Ethernet global interrupt in CubeMX.

4. Update CubeMX project without overriding your edits
After initial configuration, don‚Äôt regenerate ethernetif.c or similar manually edited files.

üß™ Testing Tips
Use HAL_ETH_ReadPHYRegister() to test communication with the PHY:

c
Copy
Edit
uint32_t phyReg;
HAL_ETH_ReadPHYRegister(&heth, 0x01, PHY_SR, &phyReg);
If you get HAL_ERROR, it means the PHY isn‚Äôt responding ‚Äî check:

RMII wiring

PHY address

Clock input (50 MHz)

üìå Summary
There‚Äôs no CubeMX version that directly includes LAN8720.

Use LAN8742 as a base.

Manually change PHY address to 0x01, and tweak initialization code.
